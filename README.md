## üåê Hosting & Domain
- Primary domain: `https://stunt-simulator.com/`
- All canonical, OG and Twitter Card URLs resolve to the domain above.
- Deploy the entire folder on any static host (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, etc.) with HTTPS enabled.

## üöÄ Local Preview
Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the folder with any static server:

```bash
npx serve .
```

## üîÅ Automated Build Workflow
The generator at `tools/generate_game_pages.py`:
1. Rebuilds `index.html` plus every file under `games/`.
2. Enforces >1,400 words per page and keeps the primary keyword between 3%‚Äì5%.
3. Rewrites `js/games-data.js` for sidebar/category data.
4. Refreshes `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` (including `lastmod`, priorities, and URL inventory).

Run it with:

```bash
python3 tools/generate_game_pages.py
```

Adjust copy in the `GAMES` list, re-run the script, and every downstream artifact updates automatically.

## ‚ú® SEO Guardrails
- Title tags: 40‚Äì60 characters each.
- Meta descriptions: 140‚Äì160 characters.
- Primary keyword density: 3%‚Äì5% per page.
- Canonical URLs: absolute paths under `https://stunt-simulator.com/‚Ä¶`.
- Full Open Graph + Twitter Card payload on every page.
- JSON-LD `VideoGame` schema injected across the site.
- `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` regenerated by the script to keep search bots in sync.

## üéÆ Game Content Highlights

- Each landing page delivers:
  - Hero section + playable iframe (CrazyGames embeds, `allow="autoplay; fullscreen"`).
  - Deep-dive article covering vehicles, maps, modes, and strategy (‚â•15 paragraphs).
  - SEO bullet list + targeted FAQ.
  - ‚ÄúMore games like ‚Ä¶‚Äù recommendation cards.
- Homepage offers curated categories (Stunt / Racing / Drift / Motorcycle / Demolition) plus FAQ anchors.

## üìà Analytics & Telemetry
- Google Analytics snippet included (`GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` placeholder).
- `js/main.js` handles page view hooks, scroll depth, fullscreen toggles, CTA tracking, etc.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization
- Add games by extending the `GAMES` array in `tools/generate_game_pages.py`; rerun the script to propagate HTML, JS metadata, and sitemap entries.
- Update global styles in `css/style.css`.
- Extend behavior in `js/main.js` if additional analytics or UI hooks are required.
